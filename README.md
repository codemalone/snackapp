# Snack App

About This Project  Libraries: RecyclerView to manage list display and underlying data changes.  Model: Item Class represents a single menu item in a flat data structure. This simplified my use of Parcelable to store and retrieve the objects on system events.

Testing: I tested this app using the UI on Android Emulator (API 28) and a physical phone (API 23).
